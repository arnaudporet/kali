Changes from version 1.1.0 to version 2.0.0.

First of all, some definitions (in addition to the ones stated in my article):

    * physiological state space: the state space of a physiological variant

    * pathological state space: the state space of a pathological variant

    * physiological basin: the basin of attraction of a physiological attractor

    * pathological basin: the basin of attraction of a pathological attractor

Basins of attraction are expressed in percent of the state space they belong.

A less strict selection of therapeutic bullets is adopted: a therapeutic bullet
is a bullet able to reduce the pathological basins without creating de novo
attractors.

This selection of therapeutic bullets includes the previous one since removing
an attractor means reducing its basin of attraction to the empty set.

To this end, the algorithm considers a bullet as therapeutic if it increases the
union of the physiological basins (equivalent to decreasing the union of the
pathological basins) in the pathological state space without creating de novo
attractors.

As a consequence, a therapeutic bullet no longer has to remove all the
pathological attractors, increasing the union of the physiological basins in the
pathological state space is sufficient.

This is expressed by the gain of the therapeutic bullet, displayed as follow:
x% --> y% where the union of the physiological basins in the pathological state
space is x% without the therapeutic bullet and y% with.

This less strict selection of therapeutic bullets allows to:

    * consider more possible therapeutic bullets

    * consider more therapeutic potential degrees

    * better analyze the effects of therapeutic bullets

#############################    MAJOR CHANGES    ##############################

Additions:

    * for each therapeutic bullet, its gain is computed and displayed

    * for each therapeutic bullet, the physiological and pathological basins in
      the pathological state space under the effect of the therapeutic bullet
      are displayed

Replacements:

    * therapeutic bullets are no longer classified as golden or silver, only
      their gain expresses their therapeutic potential
