How to use the algorithm:
    1) read my article (all is explained inside), freely available at:
        * http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4374
        * https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01024788
    2) generate the state space (S)
    3) compute the physiological attractor set (A_physio)
        * when prompted, set the setting to physiological
    4) compute the pathological attractor set (A_patho)
        * when prompted, set the setting to pathological
    5) compute the pathological attractors (A_versus)
    6) generate the bullets to test (Targ and Moda)
    7) compute therapeutic bullets (B_therap)
        * therapeutic bullets are reported as follow:
              x1[y1] x2[y2] x3[y3] ...
          meaning that the variable x has to be set to the value y
    * you can change parameter values (ntarg, maxtarg, maxmoda and maxS)
    * you can check what is already saved (S, A_physio, A_patho, A_versus, Targ, Moda and B_therap)

The algorithm automatically save/load the files it creates/uses.

These files are:
    * S.csv
    * A_physio.csv
    * A_physio.txt
    * A_patho.csv
    * A_patho.txt
    * A_versus.csv
    * A_versus.txt
    * Targ.csv
    * Moda.csv
    * B_therap.txt

The csv files are for the algorithm while the txt files are for you.

If a file already exists then the algorithm overwrites it.

If you rename, move or delete the csv files created by the algorithm then it will not be able to load them when required.

The algorithm is tested with Go version go1.6 linux/amd64 (Arch Linux).
