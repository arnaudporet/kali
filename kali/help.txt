How to use the algorithm:
    1) read my article (all is explained inside), freely available at:
        * http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4374
        * https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01024788
    2) generate the state space (S)
    3) compute the physiological attractor set (A_physio)
        * when prompted, set the setting to physiological
    4) compute the pathological attractor set (A_patho)
        * when prompted, set the setting to pathological
    5) compute the pathological attractors (A_versus)
    6) generate the bullets to test (Targ and Moda)
    7) compute therapeutic bullets (B_therap)
        * therapeutic bullets are reported as follow:
              x1[y1] x2[y2] x3[y3] ...
          meaning that the variable x has to be set to the value y
    * you can change parameter values (ntarg, maxtarg, maxmoda and maxS)
    * you can check what is already saved (S, A_physio, A_patho, A_versus, Targ, Moda and B_therap)

If you rename, move or delete the csv files created by the algorithm then it will not recognize them when required, if any.

The algorithm is tested with Go version go1.6 linux/amd64 (Arch Linux).
