* implementation of multivalued logic (which includes Boolean logic itself)

* (testing) computation of therapeutic bullets according to their ability at
increasing the physiological part of the pathological state space, namely at
increasing the size (estimated in percent of the state space) of the union of
the physiological basins in the pathological state space (displayed as
"x% --> y%" where the union of the physiological basins in the pathological
state space represents x% without the computed therapeutic bullet and y% with)
