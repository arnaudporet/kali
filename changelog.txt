* implementation of multivalued logic (which includes Boolean logic itself)

* (testing) computation of therapeutic bullets according to their ability at
  increasing the physiological part of the pathological state space, namely at
  increasing the size (estimated in percent of the state space) of the union of
  the physiological basins in the pathological state space (displayed as
  "x% --> y%" where the union of the physiological basins in the pathological
  state space represents x% without the computed therapeutic bullet and y% with)

* implementation of attractor sorting: attractors are always ordered in the same
  way regardless of the performed run

* implementation of attractor set sorting: attractor sets are always ordered in
  the same way regardless of the performed run

* silver bullets: computation of the lost physiological attractors

* implementation of therapeutic bullet set sorting: therapeutic bullet sets are
  always ordered in the same way regardless of the performed run
